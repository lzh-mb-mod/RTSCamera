This mod won&apos;t read/write anything from/into your save, so you can feel free to enable or uninstall this mod at any time.


Usage:
Please enable &quot;RTS Camera&quot; and &quot;RTSCamera.CommandSystem&quot; in launcher.
For complete usage: https://github.com/lzh-mb-mod/RTSCamera/blob/master/README.md
Press F10 to toggle free camera mode. The camera movement range is determined by scouting and tactics skill level.
Press E to lock to a unit when the camera is not locking to one.
Press E to control the unit that the camera is locking to.

Press L to open config menu during battles.
Set the &quot;Timing of Control Ally After Death&quot; option to Always to automatically control your teammate after you are down, to avoid your troops automatically charging or following AI&apos;s order.

Hotkeys:
F10  -    Toggle free camera mode
E      -    Let the camera lock to a unit, or control the unit that the camera is locking to.
L      -    Open the config menu.
All the hotkeys can be changed in config menu.

Troubleshooting
If there&apos;re a lot of &quot;text with id xxxxx doesn&apos;t exist&quot;:
    If you enabled Realm of Thrones, please move RTS Camera and Command System above it. As version 6.2 of Realm of Thrones, there&apos;s a bug in its file that causes all the mods below it cannot load text correctly.

If crash on startup, and you are using any of the following mods from me, please make sure they are updated:
- BattleMiniMap
- ImprovedCombatAI
- CinematicCamera
