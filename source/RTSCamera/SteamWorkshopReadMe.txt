Recommended:
RTS Command: another part of the RTS mod, for commanding better. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3596693285


War Sails DLC related:
When you are not piloting your ship, an order to let your soldiers to pilot the ship will be added with hotkey F5. The is the same feature as the Helmsman mod provides but compatible with RTS.
When Helmsman is installed, the order is not added for the first ship to avoid weird behavior.
As Helmsman doesn't take effect for ships other than the first one, RTS will add this order when you are controlling units on the other ships.


Dependency:
Do not require any of ButterLib/MCM/UIExtenderEx.


Compatibility:
Compatible with v1.3.4-v1.3.10 and War Sail DLC. For other versions:

Set the "Timing of Control Ally After Death" option to Always to automatically control your teammate after you are down, to avoid your troops automatically charging or following AI's order.


Hotkeys:
F10  -    Toggle free camera mode
E      -    Let the camera lock to a unit, or control the unit that the camera is locking to.

Troubleshooting
If there're a lot of "text with id xxxxx doesn't exist":
    If you enabled Realm of Thrones, please move RTS Camera and Command System above it. As version 6.2 of Realm of Thrones, there's a bug in its file that causes all the mods below it cannot load text correctly.

If crash on startup, and you are using any of the following mods from me, please make sure they are updated:
- BattleMiniMap
- ImprovedCombatAI
- CinematicCamera
