RTS Camera for v1.3.x (War Sail DLC Compatible)


Main features:
- Smoothly toggle free camera mode at any time in a battle.
- Control one of your soldiers and continue fighting/commanding after player character is injured in battle.
- Time speed control in battle. Automatic fast forward in hideout battle.


Recommended:
RTS Command: another part of the RTS mod, for commanding better. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3596693285


War Sails DLC related:
When you are not piloting your ship, an order to let your soldiers to pilot the ship will be added with hotkey F5. The is the same feature as the Helmsman mod provides but compatible with RTS.
When Helmsman is installed, the order is not added for the first ship to avoid weird behavior.
As Helmsman doesn't take effect for ships other than the first one, RTS will add this order when you are controlling units on the other ships.


Dependency:
Do not require any of ButterLib/MCM/UIExtenderEx.


Compatibility:
Compatible with v1.3.4-v1.3.13 and War Sail DLC. For other versions:
v1.2.12: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2879991660
v1.3.4-v1.3.10: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3596692403

For complete usage: https://github.com/lzh-mb-mod/RTSCamera/blob/master/README.md
Press F10 to toggle free camera mode. The camera movement range is determined by scouting and tactics skill level.

Press E to control the unit that the camera is locking to.

Press L to open config menu during battles.
Set the "Timing of Control Ally After Death" option to Always to automatically control your teammate after you are down, to avoid your troops automatically charging or following AI's order.


Hotkeys:
F10  -    Toggle free camera mode
E      -    Let the camera lock to a unit, or control the unit that the camera is locking to.
L      -    Open the config menu.
;      -     Start selecting unit using mouse clicking so that you can control it by pressing E twice.

Troubleshooting
If crash on startup, please check the following:
1. Check Modules folder and make sure there's no RTSCamera or RTSCamera.CommandSystem. If you use mods from Steam workshop then your Modules folder should be clean.
2. If you are using any of the following mods from me, please make sure they are updated:
- BattleMiniMap
- ImprovedCombatAI
- CinematicCamera


Mod Compatibility
Known performance issue with Retinues v1.3.14.21 (fixed in Retinues v1.3.14.22). You can set option "Player Formation Assignment" in RTS Camera to "Default Or General Formation" and reload the battle to avoid the performance issue.
Crash in The Old Realms is FIXED in v5.1.7.
If you use Realm of Thrones, please move RTS Camera above Realm of Thrones, or "text with id xxxxx does't exist" will show up.
Helmsman: You don't need it if you use RTS Camera. In RTS Camera you can use F5 to toggle soldier piloting, exactly the same as Helmsman, and you will get better integration with camera related features. However, if you still use Helmsman, RTS Camera will not add F5 command for the first ship to avoid conflict and weird behavior.
