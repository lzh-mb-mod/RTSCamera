For complete usage: https://github.com/lzh-mb-mod/RTSCamera/blob/master/README.md
Press F10 to toggle free camera mode. The camera movement range is determined by scouting and tactics skill level.

Press E to control the unit that the camera is locking to.

Set the "Timing of Control Ally After Death" option to Always to automatically control your teammate after you are down, to avoid your troops automatically charging or following AI's order.


Hotkeys:
F10  -    Toggle free camera mode
E      -    Let the camera lock to a unit, or control the unit that the camera is locking to.
L      -    Open the config menu.
;      -     Start selecting unit using mouse clicking so that you can control it by pressing E twice.

Troubleshooting
If crash on startup, please check the following:
1. Check Modules folder and make sure there's no RTSCamera or RTSCamera.CommandSystem. If you use mods from Steam workshop then your Modules folder should be clean.
2. If you are using any of the following mods from me, please make sure they are updated:
- BattleMiniMap
- ImprovedCombatAI
- CinematicCamera


Mod Compatibility
Crash in The Old Realms is FIXED in v5.1.7.
If you use Realm of Thrones, please move RTS Camera above Realm of Thrones, or "text with id xxxxx does't exist" will show up.
